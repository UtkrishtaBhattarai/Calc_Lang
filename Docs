ARRAYS
# define arrays by "array of int with bound [10] array_name"
# set arrays values by "array_name.set value
# get arrays values by "array_name.get index
# get array size by "array_name.size"
# display whole array contents by just "display array_name"


STRINGS
# string can be passed by enclosing them inside " ".
# if not passed through enclosing " ", the string won't be valid.
# for example: name = "string" and from console too if it asks for string, you pass it like input = "string"

INTLIT
# intlit are any numbers with no decimal values. [0-9]

REALLIT
# reallit are values with decimal in them

Question 1 : Reversing An Array
# it will the values of numbers in an array and will reverse them and show them as a array return list

Question 2 : Bubble Sort Using Nested Subroutines
# it will take number of bound for that array, then take that number of an elements and then with use of bubble sort using nested subroutines, it will swap
# the elements unless it is sorted and will display the sorted array.

Question 3



Question 4 : Company DB
# this is an example of the program that we have been implementing on our personal assignment
# the program will ask for file name, you pass it by enclosing them in " ", e.g. "acme"
# then if the file was there already, it will load the contents, if not, it will create a new file with that name. 
# it will display main menu with different options, 1 for employee, 2 for customers and 3 for exiting from system
# if you enter 1 it will display the employees and then it will show whether you would like to add an employee or return to main menu
# if you enter 1, it will ask for emp details which should be passed inside " " e.g. Name= "employee1" for string values. 
# if you enter 2, it will return to main menu. 
# Now on the main menu if you enter 2, it will take you to customer where you can add customer, add sales, view customer and their purchase and main menu. 
# Now if you enter all the details, you are supposed to return to main menu and enter 3 in order for the program to exit and save the data into the file.
